2. Write a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference. 
	- Copy by value means it creates actual duplicate in a new memory location. It is used for primitive data types like number and String. 2 different entities are created and changes in 1 don not affect other.
	- Copy by reference means both variables point to the same loaction. Shared address. Changes to 1 will reflect in the copy as well. Happens with non-primitive data type like Array and Objects. Its like having two keys of the same room shared.
